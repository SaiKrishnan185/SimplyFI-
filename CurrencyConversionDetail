Function ind_currency implementation
(Inserts commas at appropriate positions to represent thousands, lakhs, etc, as per the Indian numbering system.)

  It converts the input integer to a string.
  If the length of the string is less than or equal to 3, it returns the string representation as is.
  If the length is greater than 3, it separates the last 3 digits from the rest of the string.
  It iterates over the remaining part of the string in reverse order and inserts commas every two digits.
  Then it adds back the last 3 digits and returns the result.
